# BitPredict : Forecasting bitcoin prices using Deep Learning RNN Networks 

### Project Description: [Forecasting Bitcoin Prices using Deep Learning and RNN]()

### Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to develop an accurate forecasting model for predicting Bitcoin prices in January 2024 using deep learning techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The project will leverage historical Bitcoin price data and apply advanced deep learning methodologies to capture the temporal dependencies and complex patterns inherent in cryptocurrency markets.

### Project Objectives:

- Develop a robust deep learning model: Design and implement a deep learning model using RNNs to effectively capture the sequential nature of Bitcoin price data. The model will be trained on historical data to learn patterns and relationships, enabling it to make accurate predictions for future prices.
- Incorporate relevant features: Explore and incorporate relevant features or indicators that can enhance the forecasting accuracy of the model. This may include financial indicators, sentiment analysis from social media data, macroeconomic factors, or other external variables known to influence Bitcoin prices.
- Evaluate and optimize model performance: Evaluate the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Continuously optimize the model by adjusting hyperparameters, experimenting with different architectures, and incorporating regularization techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
- Compare with baseline methods: Compare the performance of the proposed deep learning model with traditional forecasting methods such as ARIMA, GARCH, or machine learning approaches like Support Vector Regression (SVR) or Random Forest Regression (RFR). Assess the superiority of the deep learning model in capturing complex patterns and improving prediction accuracy.
- Investigate model interpretability: Explore techniques to enhance the interpretability and explainability of the deep learning model. Analyze the importance of input features, visualize attention weights, or utilize other interpretability methods to gain insights into the factors influencing Bitcoin price predictions and provide explanations for the model's decisions.
- Real-time prediction capability: Investigate the feasibility of extending the developed model for real-time or near real-time Bitcoin price forecasting. Explore techniques to handle streaming data, adapt the model to changing market conditions, and ensure the model can provide timely and accurate predictions.

### Project Deliverables:

- Preprocessed dataset: A cleaned and preprocessed dataset of historical Bitcoin price data, including any additional features or indicators considered for the analysis.
- Deep learning model: The developed deep learning model using RNNs, along with the optimized hyperparameters and model architecture. The model should be capable of making accurate predictions for Bitcoin prices in January 2024.
- Evaluation and comparison results: Comprehensive evaluation results, including performance metrics, comparisons with baseline methods, and insights into the strengths of the deep learning model in forecasting Bitcoin prices.
- Interpretability analysis: Interpretability analysis showcasing the factors influencing the model's predictions, feature importance, and visualization of attention weights or other interpretability techniques.
- Documentation and report: A well-documented report detailing the project methodology, experimental setup, results, and conclusions. The report will also discuss the research gaps addressed, limitations, potential future enhancements, and the significance of the findings in the field of Bitcoin price forecasting.
